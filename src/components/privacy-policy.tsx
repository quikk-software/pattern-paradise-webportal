                right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time for reasons

              <p>
                We use <strong>NextAuth.js</strong> together with <strong>Keycloak</strong> to
                manage secure user authentication via the OAuth 2.0 protocol. When you log in, your
                authentication data (e.g., user ID, token) is processed by these services to verify
                your identity and manage sessions.
              </p>
              <p>
                All authentication infrastructure is <strong>self-hosted</strong> and fully managed
                by us. We do <strong>not</strong> rely on any third-party authentication providers
                or external identity services. Your authentication data remains within our
                controlled environment.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our websites use so-called &apos;cookies&apos;. Cookies are small text files and do
                not cause any damage to your device. They are stored either temporarily for the
                duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies) on your
                device. Session cookies are automatically deleted at the end of your visit.
                Permanent cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them yourself or
                until they are automatically deleted by your web browser.
              </p>
              <p>
                In some cases, cookies from third-party companies may also be stored on your device
                when you enter our site (third-party cookies). These enable us or you to use certain
                services of the third-party company (e.g. cookies for processing payment services).
              </p>
              <p>
                Cookies have various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary, as certain
                website functions would not work without them (e.g. the shopping cart function or
                the display of videos). Other cookies are used to evaluate user behavior or display
                advertising.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cookies that are necessary to carry out the electronic communication process
                (necessary cookies) or to provide certain functions that you have requested
                (functional cookies, e.g. for the shopping cart function) or to optimize the website
                (e.g. cookies to measure the web audience) are stored on the basis of Art. 6 (1)
                lit. f GDPR, unless another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a
                legitimate interest in storing cookies for the technically error-free and optimized
                provision of its services. If consent to store cookies has been requested, the
                storage of the cookies in question is based exclusively on this consent (Art. 6
                para. 1 lit. a GDPR); consent can be revoked at any time.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and
                only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for
                certain cases or in general and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when
                closing the browser. When deactivating cookies, the functionality of this website
                may be limited.
              </p>
              <p>
                Insofar as cookies are used by third-party companies or for analysis purposes, we
                will inform you separately about this within the framework of this data protection
                declaration and, if necessary, request your consent.

              <p>
                The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called
                server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2">
                <li>Browser type and browser version</li>

              <p>This data is not merged with other data sources.</p>
              <p>
                The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website
                operator has a legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and
                optimization of its website - for this purpose, the server log files must be
                collected.
              </p>

                If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your details from the inquiry form,
                including the contact details you provided there, will be stored by us for the
                purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. We do not pass

              </p>
              <p>
                The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR, if your request is
                related to the execution of a contract or if it is necessary to carry out
                pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our
                legitimate interest in the effective processing of the requests addressed to us
                (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR) if this has been
                requested.
              </p>
              <p>
                The data you enter in the contact form remains with us until you request us to
                delete it, revoke your consent to store it, or the purpose for storing the data no

                statutory provisions - in particular retention periods - remain unaffected.

              <p>
                If you contact us by e-mail, telephone, or fax, your request, including all
                resulting personal data (name, request) will be stored and processed by us for the
                purpose of processing your request. We do not pass on this data without your
                consent.
              </p>
              <p>
                The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR, if your request is

                The data you send to us via contact requests remains with us until you request us to

              <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mb-1">Newsletter Data</h4>
              <p>
                If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we require an
                e-mail address from you as well as information that allows us to verify that you are
                the owner of the e-mail address provided and that you agree to receive the
                newsletter. Further data is not collected or only on a voluntary basis. We use this
                data exclusively for sending the requested information and do not pass it on to
                third parties.
              </p>
              <p>
                The processing of the data entered in the newsletter registration form is based
                exclusively on your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR). You can revoke your consent to
                the storage of the data, the e-mail address, and their use for sending the
                newsletter at any time, for example via the &apos;unsubscribe&apos; link in the
                newsletter. The legality of the data processing operations already carried out
                remains unaffected by the revocation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The data you provide for the purpose of receiving the newsletter will be stored by
                us or the newsletter service provider until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and
                will be deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the
                newsletter or after the purpose has ceased to apply. We reserve the right to delete
                or block e-mail addresses from our newsletter distribution list at our own
                discretion within the scope of our legitimate interest in accordance with Art.
                6(1)(f) GDPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail address may
                be stored by us or the newsletter service provider in a blacklist to prevent future
                mailings. The data from the blacklist is used only for this purpose and is not
                merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying
                with the legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the
                meaning of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is indefinite. You may
                object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.
