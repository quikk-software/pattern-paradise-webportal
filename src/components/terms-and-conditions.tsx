                  Users under the age of 18 may only use Pattern Paradise with the permission and
                  supervision of a parent or legal guardian. By granting access, the parent or
                  guardian accepts these Terms and Conditions on the minor&apos;s behalf and takes
                  responsibility for their use of the platform.

                If you&apos;re under 18, your parent or guardian needs to give permission and help
                guide your use of the platform. They agree to the rules for you, so it&apos;s
                important they&apos;re involved.

                  By uploading content to Pattern Paradise, you grant us a non-exclusive,
                  royalty-free license to use it for the limited purpose of operating and promoting
                  the platform. This includes activities such as displaying your content on
                  listings, featuring it in search previews, or sharing it in marketing formats
                  (e.g., on social media or in newsletters) â€” always linking back to your original
                  listing. You retain full ownership of your content, and we will never sell or
                  distribute your pattern files themselves. Our use of your content is always within
                  the context of promoting your listing or the overall platform, not for independent
                  commercial gain.
                </p>
              </div>
              <PracticalExample>
                Uploading a pattern means we may promote it by creating things like Pinterest Pins
                or Google Shopping listings using your product image and title â€” all to drive more
                traffic to your listing. We don&apos;t claim ownership of your design or share the
                pattern file itself â€” we&apos;re just helping people find it.

                  The license we rely on to operate and promote your content ends once you remove
                  the content from Pattern Paradise. We will no longer use it in any active or
                  public-facing way. Please note, however, that we cannot control how third-party
                  systems like search engines or social media platforms handle cached or previously
                  indexed content, which may remain visible beyond our reach.

                Once you delete your listing, we won&apos;t show or promote it on the platform
                anymore. Your pattern and listing will no longer be accessible to other users.
                However, some copies may still exist on services like Google Search or Pinterest,
                where we have no technical ability to remove previously indexed content.

                  You can remove your content anytime. We may also remove content that violates our
                  terms or could negatively impact the platform or its users. We do not remove
                  content arbitrarily. In cases where an issue arises, we will make reasonable
                  efforts to contact the creator and provide an opportunity to respond or correct
                  the issue. If we do not receive a response within a reasonable period of time, we
                  reserve the right to moderate or remove the content without further notice.

                You can take down your own listing at any time. If we find a listing that violates
                our rules, we&apos;ll try to reach out to you first to sort things out. But if we
                don&apos;t hear back in a reasonable timeframe, we may need to remove it to protect
                the platform and its users.

                  Payments are handled via Stripe or PayPal. We take a 5% commission on sales.
                  Refunds are not available once a digital product is downloaded. This is because
                  digital files, once accessed, cannot be returned in the same way physical goods
                  can, and the content could already have been copied or used.

              <PracticalExample>
                If you sell a $10 pattern, you keep $9.50 before Stripe/PayPal fees. Once a buyer
                downloads the file, the purchase is final â€” just like opening a digital book or PDF.
                Since the content is immediately accessible and non-returnable, we can&apos;t offer
                refunds after download.

                  Reviews must reflect real experiences and must not be abusive or misleading.
                  Reviews should be directly related to the pattern and may include feedback about
                  the overall experience with the creator. While we welcome critique, we do not
                  remove reviews arbitrarily. However, content that includes insults, hate speech,
                  or otherwise harmful behavior will be swiftly moderated and may be removed.

                You can leave a review for a pattern you&apos;ve bought or tested, and it&apos;s
                okay to give honest, even critical feedback â€” as long as it&apos;s respectful and
                relevant. We won&apos;t remove reviews just because they&apos;re negative, but if
                they include insults or harmful language, we will step in.

                  control or endorse the content, products, policies, or practices of those
                  third-party sites. Accessing such sites is at your own discretion, and we are not

                If you follow a link from Pattern Paradise to another website â€” for example, to buy

                  content as necessary to maintain a safe, respectful, and functional environment.
                  However, content is not removed arbitrarily. Actions we take under this policy are
                  consistent with the terms outlined in sections such as Contribution License,
                  Removal of Contributions, and Reviews. In general, we will attempt to resolve
